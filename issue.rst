    As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.

Modern technologies have completely changed our world and led humanity into a wholly new era, despite the prevailing doubts that people may depend too heavily on technologies for a solution when confronted with a problem and thus gradually become unable to think independently. However, I am strongly convinced that the increasing dependence upon technologies for solutions does not necessarily imply degeneration of one's free thinking.

Problem-solving technologies free people from tedious trivia and allow people to concentrate on the big picture from a more abstract perspective. Some details and minor problems, though inconspicuous, can sometimes be crucial for a project, thus becoming huge distractions that lead away the attention to the project as a whole. For example, Engineers and physicists in the 1950s, despite their excellence at theoretical derivation and mathematical modeling, were compelled to perform hand-calculation in real-life engineering problems, because computers were not at all prevailing at that time, while today's technicians and scientists, now backed with supercomputers, have been yielding one and another breakthrough which is at least comparable with their pioneers, or even much more outstanding when speaking of scale. If there were no advancement in technologies that enable large-scale manufacture of affordable machines to assist people and to handle low-level work, most modern scientific and engineering progress would be otherwise as infeasible as fantasies. 

Once deprived of the tediousness to care the trivial details in the process of solving problems, contemporary people reveal much better imagination than precedents, which is a direct indicator of enhanced free thinking. For example, integrated circuits with billions of transistors, which were unimaginable in the nineteenth century when steam-powered machines were fading out and electricity was just under expansion, while in modern times it is also unimaginable for any digital circuit designer to manually place each specific transistor, out of a billion transistors onto the layout blueprint, because today's engineers are allowed to design with description of functions, not specific logics. 

What has to be mentioned is that, despite the importance of independent thinking in the past, today's problems tend to be too complex, not only from the perspective of depth but also from an aspect of scale, to be within the grasp of an individual regardless of his excellent free thinking. It is now a fashion, as well as a necessity, to apply grouped wisdom which is combined with many people's ideas onto specific problem-solving cases. Euler, a 18th century mathematician, has discovered hundreds of math axioms and theorems totally independently on his own. However, it would be impossible for Wiles, a contemporary British mathematician, not to combine other mathematicians' work and extend it with his own free thinking when he was proving Fermat's last theorem. 

Admittedly, overly dependence upon technologies is probably yielding laziness, due to which people tend to refuse to think further, since machines are doing a very great job. However, it is not the technologies that are to be blamed for people being reluctant in thought; rather, it is the nature of human, which is inevitably driving demands for leisure, idleness and comfort, that is to be blamed. In conclusion, what modern people should worry about is not technologies but always their own nature, as is the case ever since.

    To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.
